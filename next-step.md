# Rise Beyond APP - Development Session Summary

## Project Overview
**Rise Beyond APP (Ribapp)** is a comprehensive cerebral palsy (CP) care management platform built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application connects three key stakeholders in CP care: Physiotherapists, Community Health Workers (CHWs), and Patients/Caregivers.

  - Dr. Marie Claire Mukamana (Speech Therapist)
- **Enhanced Q&A System**: Ask questions, get expert answers, community interaction
- **Progress Tracking**: Gamified therapy progress with achievements

### 2. **Early Detection System**
- **Four-Tab Interface**: Overview, Warning Signs, Assessment Quiz, Next Steps
- **Age-Based Warning Signs**: 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 12+ months categories
- **Interactive Quiz**: Evidence-based questions with risk assessment
- **Educational Content**: Statistics, professional guidance, reminder system
- **Scrollable Dialog**: Integrated into patient dashboard as "Did You Know" card

### 3. **Smart Assessment Form**
- **Five Sections**: Patient Info, Medical Background, Functional Assessment, Motor Evaluation, Rehabilitation Summary
- **Device Recommendations**: Written recommendations for assistive devices
- **CHW Assignment**: Assign Rwandan CHWs to patients
- **Discharge Management**: Handle discharged patients with follow-up planning
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation and error handling

### 4. **Enhanced UI Components**
- **Custom UI Library**: Dialog, Select, Textarea, Input, Label, Popover components
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern translucent effects with backdrop blur
- **Gradient Styling**: Beautiful color gradients throughout the interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Professional Medical Theme**: Clean, accessible, healthcare-grade interface

## Technical Architecture

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State Management**: React useState hooks
